An Ansible role for installing pip (the python package installer) to the system.

This role also ensures pip has the defined version by upgrading pip using pip.

__See https://pypi.org/project/pip/#history[pip's pypi release history] for available `pip`-versions.__

_See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/[pip's documentation] for a__
_human-made changelog of the `pip`-project which contains information useful to end users_
_(As described in their https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/contributing/#news-entries[Contribution Guidelines])._

[[meta]]
== üîé Metadata
Below you can find information on‚Ä¶

* the role's required Ansible version
* the role's supported platforms
* the role's https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies[role dependencies]

[[requirements]]
== üìå Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.


The https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general[`community.general` collection]
must be installed on the Ansible controller.


[[variables]]
== üìú Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.


[source,yaml]
----
pip_version: ">=20"
----
The version of pip to install using pip after pip was installed
in form of a https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers[pip requirement specifier].

[source,yaml]
----
pip_package: "python3-pip"
----
The name of the package(s) to install to get `pip` on the system.
For older systems that don't have Python 3 available, you can set this to `python-pip`.

[source,yaml]
----
pip_executable: "{{ 'pip3' if pip_package.startswith('python3') else 'pip' }}"
----
The role will try to autodetect the pip executable based on the `pip_package`
(e.g. `pip` for Python 2 and `pip3` for Python 3). You can also override this explicitly, e.g. `pip_executable: pip3.6`.



[[dependencies]]
== üë´ Dependencies
// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.



[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users.
