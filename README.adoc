An Ansible role for installing pip (the python package installer) to the system.

This role can also be used to install a specific set of pip packages
to either the system or in a virtualenv.

This role also ensures pip has the defined version by upgrading pip using pip.

[TIP]
See https://pypi.org/project/pip/#history[pip's pypi release history] for available `pip`-versions.

[TIP]
See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/[the pip documentation]
for a human-generated change log of the `pip` project
that contains useful information for end users
(Maintained as described in their https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/contributing/#news-entries[Contribution Guidelines]).

* the role's required Ansible version
* the role's supported platforms
* the role's https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies[role dependencies]

[[requirements]]
== üìå Requirements
// Any prerequisites that may not be covered by this role or Ansible itself should be mentioned here.
The Ansible User needs to be able to `become`.


The https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general[`community.general` collection]
must be installed on the Ansible controller.


[[variables]]
== üìú Role Variables
// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here
// and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role.
// Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.)
// should be mentioned here as well.

[source,yaml]
----
pip_version: ">=20"
----
The version of pip to install using pip after pip was installed
in form of a https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers[pip requirement specifier].

[source,yaml]
----
pip_package: "python3-pip"
----
The name of the package(s) to install to get `pip` on the system.
For older systems that don't have Python 3 available, you can set this to `python-pip`.

[source,yaml]
----
pip_virtualenv_packages: "virtualenv"
----
The name of the package(s) to install to get `virtualenv` on the system.

[source,yaml]
----
pip_executable: "{{ 'pip3' if pip_package.startswith('python3') else 'pip' }}"
----
The role will try to autodetect the pip executable based on the `pip_package`
(e.g. `pip` for Python 2 and `pip3` for Python 3). You can also override this explicitly, e.g. `pip_executable: pip3.6`.

[source,yaml]
----
pip_install_packages: []
----
A list of packages to install with
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/pip_module.html[pip].

Each entry may either be a simple string (shorthand for `- name: ‚Ä¶`)
or an own object with below properties:

_chdir_::
`cd` into this directory before running the command.

name::
The name of a Python library to install or the url(bzr+,hg+,git+,svn+) of the remote package.

version::
The version number to install of the Python library specified in the name parameter.

requirements::
Instead of using `name` and `version` to define a single package inline
you may also use this option to reference to a path of a pip requirements file,
which should be local to the _remote_ system.
File can be specified as a relative path if using the `chdir` option.

state::
The state of the pip module (i.e. absent / forcereinstall / latest / *present*)

umask::
_Defaults to `pip_install_packages_umask` if exists._
+
The system umask to apply before installing the pip package.
This is useful, for example, when installing on systems that have a very restrictive umask by default
(e.g., "0077") and you want to pip install packages which are to be used by all users.
Note that this requires you to specify desired umask mode as an octal string, (e.g., "0022").

virtualenv::
_Defaults to `pip_install_packages_virtualenv` if exists._
+
Path to a virtualenv directory to install into.
If the virtualenv does not exist, it will be created before installing packages.
The optional `virtualenv_command`, and `virtualenv_python` options affect the creation of the virtualenv.

virtualenv_command::
_Defaults to `pip_install_packages_virtualenv_command` if exists._
+
The command or a pathname to the command to create the virtual environment with.
For example `pyvenv`, *`virtualenv`*, `virtualenv2`, `~/bin/virtualenv`, `/usr/local/bin/virtualenv`.

virtualenv_python::
_Defaults to `pip_install_packages_virtualenv_python` if exists._
+
The Python executable used for creating the virtual environment.
For example python3.5, python2.7.
When not specified, the Python version used to run the ansible module is used.
This parameter should not be used when `virtualenv_command` is using `pyvenv` or the `-m venv` module.

virtualenv_site_packages::
_Defaults to `pip_install_packages_virtualenv_python` if exists._
+
Whether the virtual environment will inherit packages from the global site-packages directory.
Note that if this setting is changed on an already existing virtual environment
it will not have any effect - the environment must be deleted and newly created.

extra_args::
_Defaults to `pip_install_packages_extra_args` if exists._
+
Extra arguments passed to pip.

environment::
_Defaults to `pip_install_packages_environment` if exists._
+
Environment Variables passed to the pip module.

// A list of other roles should go here,
// plus any details in regard to parameters that may need to be set for other roles,
// or variables that are used from other roles.



[[example_playbooks]]
== üìö Example Playbook Usages
// Including examples of how to use this role in a playbook for common scenarios is always nice for users.
